        <p>Firstly, I learnt the use of basic tags of HTML & CSS  from lecturer, friends & YouTube. It was quite difficult to grasp this concept in the initial phase as I was newbie to it. "HTML & CSS : Design and Build Web Sites" book written by Jon Duckett also helped me a lot.</p>

        <p>Then, I started to work out on my assignment. I had faced issues while aligning tags at its correct position. I adjusted it by inspecting element in the browser. Each time, when I had made some changes, I updated about it on GitHub.</p>
